title: Up and Running!

This is my first blog post. I'm excited to be starting this next step towards a successful and creative career. I plan on using this site for side projects, as well as spouting off the occasional book review. Can't wait to get to work.

I'm having trouble thinking of a great idea to start though. I think a great place to begin might be to play with some APIs I've found to be interesting, like the Genius API, which is the website with official song lyrics and explanations. I've reached out to the Instagram page webofbars (an account doing these small lyric stats snapshots) to see how I could hop aboard and help. They responded and said try and get with a designer to display some unique stats you can find. I'll worry about the design later. Time to start scraping.
